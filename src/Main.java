        * Scenario: You are a back-end developer and need to create an application to handle new customer bank account requests.
        *
        * Your application should do the following:
        *   - Read a .csv file of names, social security numbers, account type, and initial deposit.
        *   - Use a proper data structure to hold all these accounts
        *   - Both savings and checking accounts share the following properties:
        *       [deposit(), withdraw(), transfer(), snowInfo()]
        *
        *       11 - Digit Account Number (generated with the following process: 1 or 2 depending on Savings or Checking, last two digits of SSN, unique 5-digit number, and
        *       random 3-digit number)
        *   - Savings Account holders are given a Safety Deposit Box, identified by a 3-digit number and accessed with a 4-digit code
        *   - Checking Account holders are assigned a Debit Card with a 12-digit number and 4-digit PIN
        *   - Both accounts will use an interface that determines the base interest rate.
        *       Savings accounts will use .25 points less than the base rate
        *       Checking accounts will use 15% of the base rate
        *   - The SnowInfo method should reveal relevant account information as well as information specific to the Checking account or Savings account.
        *
        * Learning objectives:
        *   - Learn to develop a robust application architecture
        *   - Use when to use abstract classes and abstract methods
        *   - Use an interface API to receive information from a developer's application
        *   - Explore constructors deeper and use the super() keyword
        *   - Explore access modifiers and when to use public, private, or protected
        *   - Read data from a file and store in an appropriate data structure
        *   - Generate random numbers and work with String API
        * */
